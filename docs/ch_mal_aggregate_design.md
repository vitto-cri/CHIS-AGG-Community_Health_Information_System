## 1.Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Malaria module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for malaria
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on malaria
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Malaria” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the Malaria module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the Malaria module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Malaria”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data the activities present in the different sections of the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
