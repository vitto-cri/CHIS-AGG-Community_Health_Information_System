## 1. Dataset Configuration

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence (CPIPV) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for child protection and interpersonal violence
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on child protection and interpersonal violence
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the CPIPV module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the CPIPV module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2.Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Service Referral

The section is set to collect the information necessary to identify the causes of intervention (child maltreatment, MH status of caregiver, alcohol use by caregiver, drugs use by caregiver, other) and the services of referral (health facility, psychological support, legl, shelter, other). The categories can be edited to better mirror the local context.

### 2.2.1. FGM

The section reports the core information on FGM practices in the community. The data are disaggregated by age groups depending on the target population (15-19y, 20-49y, unknown age; or 0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, unknown age).

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Child Protection and Interpersonal Violence”.
The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.

![Dashboards](resources/images/chis-cpiv-db-001.png)

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
