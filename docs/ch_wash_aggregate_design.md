## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) module includes:

1. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information
2. **Core indicators** for the dataset
3. A predefined **“CH - WASH” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the WASH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations. In this case the DEs in the WASH module are not shared among any other module.

All the DEs in the WASH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Yearly WASH Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Drinking Water

The section reports data on access to drinking water among the assessed households. The disaggregation of the data is by type of source of water (piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, packaged or delivered water - the categories should be adapted to better mirror the local context).

![Drinking Water](resources/images/chis-wash-y-001.png)

#### 2.1.2. Water Quality

The section focuses on the tests conducted on the water. The tests are disaggregated by results (positive and negative) and/or by source of the water (piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, packaged or delivered water - the categories should be adapted to better mirror the local context).

![Water Quality](resources/images/chis-wash-y-002.png)

#### 2.1.3. Hand-Washing Facilities

The section reports the presence of fixed or mobile hand-washing facilities among the households. The disaggregation of the facilities is by location (dwelling, plot/yard, elsewhere). The categories can be edited according to the local context.

![Hand-Washing Facilities](resources/images/chis-wash-y-003.png)

#### 2.1.4.Improved/Shared Sanitation

The section provides information on households sharing facilities (disaggregated by type of facility) and those having access to improved facilities (disaggregated by type of improved facility).

![Improved/Shared Sanitation](resources/images/chis-wash-y-004.png)

#### 2.1.5. Emptying of On-Site Sanitation Facilities

The section reports data on sanitation that are located on site and how they are emptied, if ever. The information is disaggregated by emptying method (service provider, buried, uncovered pit, open ground, water body, elsewhere - the options should be adapted to better mirror the local context) and by type of toilet/storage (latrines, septic tanks, composting toilet, twin pits).

![Emptying of On-Site Sanitation Facilities](resources/images/chis-wash-y-005.png)

#### 2.1.6. Hygiene Facilities

The section collects information on women and their accessibility to hygenic spaces and materials during their menses. The data on hygiene product is disaggregated by product type (Sanitary pads - disposable, sanitary pads - reusable, cloths - disposable, cloths - reusable, tampons - disposable, menstrual cups - reusable, other - disposable, other - reusable, none).

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - WASH”.

The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.
