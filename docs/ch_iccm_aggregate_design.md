# CH - Integrated community case management (ICCM) { #ch-iccm-aggregate-design }

## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - ICCM module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for ICCM
2. **Core indicators** for both datasets
3. A predefined **“CH - ICCM” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the ICCM module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the ICCM module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Child Health - Newborn

The section is set to collect the information necessary to have a snapshot of the health of the children in the community. The table collects data on danger signs and the reactivity of the community upon those signs by age groups (0-27d, 28d-11m, 1-4y,5-9y unknown age).

![Child Health - Newborn](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-001.png)

### 2.2. Child Health - Nutrition

The section collects data on malnutrition by age groups (6-11m and 12-59m).

![Child Health - Nutrition](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-002.png)

### 2.3. Child Health - Diarrhoea

The section focuses on diarrhoea and rehydration by age group (0-4y, 5-9y) and its treatment (ORS, Zinc, both).

### 2.4. Child Health - Fast Breathing

The section collects info on possible chest infections and respiratory problems by age groups (0-11m, 1-4y, 5-9y, unknown age) and symptoms (fast breathing, chest indrawing, both).

### 2.6. Malaria - Febrile Cases Tested

The section collects data about suspected febrile cases, tested cases, and confirmed cases of malaria. The info is disaggregated by age groups (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age).

![Suspected Cases Tested](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-006.png)

### 2.7. Malaria - Cases by Parasite

The malaria section could also be set up as the tables below, where the data are collected by Plasmodium spp.

![Malaria - Cases by Parasite](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-007.png)

### 2.8. Malaria - Treatment

The cases in this table are tallied by type of case vs. treatment with first line antimalarials( combination of age groups - 0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age - and result - confirmed with RDT, suspected, febrile not confirmed).

![Malaria - Treatment](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-008.png)

### 2.9. Malaria - Danger Signs

In this table there is a focus on children in the second table with danger signs and referrals of children up to the age of 9 years by age groups (0-11m, 1-4y, 5-9y, unknown age).

![Malaria - Danger Signs](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-009.png)

### 2.10. Immunization - Never Vaccinated

The section focuses on children up to four years of age and on how many among the screened ones are completely unvaccinated.

![Immunization - Never Vaccinated](resources/images/chis-iccm-m-010.png)

### 2.11. Immunization - Not Up to Date

The section collects the data for people and women who are not up to date with the vaccination calendar according to their stage of life and pregnancy.

### 2.14. HIV Test - Key Population

The table captures data for the key population groups at risk (MSM, SW, Prisoners, IDU, TG, Other). The categories should be adapted locally to better mirror the contexts and the activities.
