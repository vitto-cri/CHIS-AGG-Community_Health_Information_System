## 1.Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Child Health (ChH) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for child health
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on child health
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Child Health” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

## 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the ChH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the ChH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly Child Health Dataset

The [United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/gb/reports/humanitarian/uncrc19-summary2.pdf) defines a child as every human being **below the age of 18 years**, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. **This module focuses more specifically on children between the age of 29 days and 9 years**. In both the monthly and the yearly datasets the category combinations for the age groups have age groups that go beyond the definition. This has been done to avoid creating *ad hoc* age groups for each and every dataset. The age groups above the definition of Child have been greyed-out and therefore blocked for data entry. Countries should nonetheless edit and apply the age categories that better reflect the local context and guidelines.

#### 2.1.1. Infant Feeding

The section is set to collect the number of CHWs consultations to infants and about appropriate feeding.

![Infant feeding](resources/images/chis-cdh-m-001.png)

#### 2.1.2. Deworming

The first part of the section is set to give an overview of the target population for the activity by age group (1-4Y, 5-9Y, 140-14Y, 15-19Y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex), and the number of reached people (same disaggregation). The second part of the section divides the reached people by type of preventive chemotherapy (Albendazole and Mebendazole). The used drugs can be adapted locally based on availability and national guidelines.

![Deworming](resources/images/chis-cdh-m-002.png)

#### 2.1.3. Vitamin A Supplement - Routine

This section of the monthly dataset focuses only on routine activities dedicated to the distribution of Vit A supplements to children during the first and second semester of the year. This has two subsections with the first focusing on routine vitamin A supplementation with children by age groups (6-11m and 12-59m) and by age and the administered IUs (100000 IU and 200000 IU).

#### 2.1.4. Vitamin A Supplement - Events

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Child Health”.
The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
