## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration

The aggregate CH - Newborn Health module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for newborn health
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on newborn health
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Newborn Health”** dashboard

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the Newborn health module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the Newborn Health module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly Newborn Health Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Live Births

This section is a simple agrgegation of the number of live births in the community by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Live Births](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-001.png)

#### 2.1.2. Breastfeeding and Birth Weight

This section collects the basic information needed to get an overview of the weight and breastfeeding habits upon birth.

![Breastfeeding and Birth Weight](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-002.png)

#### 2.1.3. Preterm Delivery

The section gathers data on preterm deliveries and the use of KMC in the community. The data is disaggregated by age of the mother (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age) in the case of KMC, and by sex in the case of preterm babies (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Preterm Delivery](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-003.png)

#### 2.1.4. Newborns and Children with Danger Signs

The section gathers information on danger signs identified among newborn babies and children in the community. The information is disaggregated by age groups (0-27d, 28d-11m, 1-4y, 5-9y, unknown age).

![Newborns and Children with Danger Signs](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-004.png)

#### 2.1.5. Skin-to-skin Contact

This provides the space to report the simple aggregate on the number of newborns and preterm babies put to skin-to-skin contact after birth.

![Skin-to-skin Contact](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-005.png)

#### 2.1.6. Cutting the Umbilical Cord

This provides the space to report the simple aggregate on the number of umbilical cord cutting procedures carried out with clean or sterile instruments.

The information is disaggregated by the type of person performing the cut (lay person, CHW) - the options should be modified locally to better mirror the context.

![Skin-to-skin Contact](resources/images/chis-nbh-m-006.png)

### 2.2. Yearly Newborn Health Dataset

#### 2.2.1. Stillbirths and Neonatal Deaths

This section gathers data on neonatal deaths disaggregated by age (0-6d, 7-27d, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex); and on stillbirths by gestational age (22-37w, 38-41w, 42+w, unknown age).

## 3. Validation Rules

The following validation rules have been set up for the Adolescent health datasets:

## 4. Analytics and Indicators

Just as for the DEs, in the table below the column “Indicator Groups” provides information about whether the indicator is found in groups other than the aH indicator group.

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Newborn Health”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
