## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Tuberculosis (TB) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Tuberculosis” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the TB module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the TB module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly TB Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - All

The section focuses on all the people benefiting from MH assessments and referrals. The data are disaggregated by age (10-14y, 15-19y, 20-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown).

#### 2.1.2. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - by Type

The information collected on the general population (section 2.1.1.) can also be disaggregated by type of condition (depression, psychoses, behavioural conditions, dementia, substance use, suicide/self harm) - the conditions should be edited and adapted to the local context.

#### 2.1.3. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - Pregnant and Postpartum

This section collects the same variables as the other two sections on MH, but it focuses specifically on pregnant and postpartum women benefiting from MH community activities.

### 2.1.2. Legal and Economic Support

The section gathers information on the eligible people who can benefit from legal and economic support.

#### 2.1.3. TB TPT

The section collects a wide range of data about TB preventive treatment. The first table targets people who completed the TPT by target category (PLHIV and contact - the options should be adapted locally to better mirror the context). The second bigger table summarises the info on people receiving TPT and their contacts. The information is disaggregated by age group (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-34y, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y, 50+y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![TB TPT](resources/images/chis-tb-m-003.png)

The third table gives more information on the HIV status of the people benefitting from the TPT. The information can be disaggregated by status (Positive or negative) and/or by TPT treatment regimen (GH, 4R, 3HP, 3HR, 1HP) and by HIV status (positive or negative).

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Tuberculosis”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

 The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
