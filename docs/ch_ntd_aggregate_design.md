## 1.Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration summary

The aggregate CH - Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for NTDs
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on adolescent health
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - NTDs” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the NTDs module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the NTDs module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2.Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly NTDs Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - All

The section focuses on all the people benefiting from MH assessments and referrals. The data are disaggregated by age (10-14y, 15-19y, 20-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown).

#### 2.1.2. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - by Type

The information collected on the general population (section 2.1.1.) can also be disaggregated by type of condition (depression, psychoses, behavioural conditions, dementia, substance use, suicide/self harm) - the conditions should be edited and adapted to the local context.

#### 2.1.3. Mental Health Disorders and Conditions - Pregnant and Postpartum

This section collects the same variables as the other two sections on MH, but it focuses specifically on pregnant and postpartum women benefiting from MH community activities.

#### 2.2.4. NTDs and PC

The section collects the information about rumours on Guinea worms and Yaws cases and on PC in the community. The data are aggregated by age groups (0-4y, 5-9y, 10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex). The same disaggregation is applied to the reported cases (third table).

The second table collects the totals on PC activities but with more information on the specific targeted disease - The diseases in the cat combo at the moment are: Lymphatic filariasis, Onchocerciasis, Schistosomiasis, Soil-transmitted helminths, Taeniasis, Trachomas, Yaws, and Others. The specified diseases should be edited and better adapted to mirror the local context.

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - NTDs”.

The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.
