# CH - Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) { #ch-crvs-aggregate-design }

## 1. Datasets

## 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - CRVS module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for CRVS
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on CRVS
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Civil registration and vital statistics” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the CRVS module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the CRVS module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly CRVS Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Birth and Death Registration

The section is set to collect the information necessary to identify births and deaths in the community on a monthly basis by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Birth and Death Registration](resources/images/chis-crvs-m-001.png)

## 2.2. Yearly CRVS Dataset

### 2.2.1. Live Births

The section reports the core information on deliveries in the community. The data are disaggregated by age of the mother (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age) and by sex of the child (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Live Births](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-001.png)

### 2.2.2. Pregnancy-related Deaths

The section provides an overview of the women’s deaths during pregnancy and delivery by the age of the mother (10-14y, 15-19y, 20+y, unknown age).

![Pregnancy-related Deaths](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-002.png)

### 2.2.3. Stillbirths and Neonatal Deaths

The section collects the data on neonatal deaths (occurring before the 28th day from birth) by age group (0-6d, 7-27d, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex); and on stillbirths by gestational week (22-37w, 38-41w, 42+w, unknown age). The lower limit for the stillbirth gestational age has been set at 22 weeks as per international standards. If any other national guidelines have different thresholds (e.g. 20 weeks) the lower threshold can be changed accordingly.

![Stillbirths and Neonatal Deaths](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-003.png)

### 2.2.4. Child Deaths

The section collects the data the deaths of children under up tp nine years of age by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Child Deaths](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-004.png)

### 2.2.5. Adolescent Deaths

The section collects the data on the deaths of adolescent by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Adolescent Deaths](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-005.png)

### 2.2.6. Adult Deaths

The section collects the data on the number of adult deaths by age groups (20-29y, 30-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70-79y, 80+y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Adult Deaths](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-005b.png)

### 2.2.7. Deaths Due to Accidents

The adult deaths can also be collected by cause in case there is the need to put the accent on accident-related deaths. The data can be disaggregated by age groups (20-29y, 30-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70-79y, 80+y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).
The causes can be adapted locally to better reflect the context and its leading causes.

![Deaths Due to Accidents](resources/images/chis-crvs-y-005c.png)

### 2.2.8. Birth and Death Registration

The reports the numbers of births that have been reported and registered in the national CRVS by age (0-11m, 1-4y) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex). The section also includes the totals for deaths reported and certified.

## 3. Validation Rules

The following validation rules have been set up for the CRVS datasets:

## 4. Analytics and Indicators

Just as for the DEs, in the table below the column “Indicator Groups” provides information about whether the indicator is found in groups other than the CRVS indicator group.

| Name                                                             | Description                                                                                                                       | Numerator                                          | Denominator                          | Indicator Groups                                                          |

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Civil registration and vital statistics”.
The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
