## 1.Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for NCDs
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on NCDs
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Non-communicable diseases”** dashboard

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the AH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the NCD module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly NCDs Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Heart Attack and Stroke

The section gathers the data related to adults older than 40 years at risk of cardiovascular diseases and to patients receiving support. The data are disaggregated by age (40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70-79y, 80+y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Heart Attack and Stroke](resources/images/chis-ncd-m-001.png)

### 2.2. Yearly NCDs Dataset

#### 2.2.1. Clean Energy

This is a simple overview of the number of households relying on clean energy for cooking. The options in the disaggregation should be edited according to the local context.

![Clean Energy](resources/images/chis-ncd-y-001.png)

#### 2.2.2. Cervical Cancer Screening

The section provides the information on the women in the community and whether they have been or should have been screened.

![Cervical Cancer Screening](resources/images/chis-ncd-y-002.png)

#### 2.2.3. Blood Pressure

The information collected in this section relates to raised blood pressure measurements either among the general population or among women during ANC visits or during delivery. In the former the disaggregation is by age (10-14y, 15-19y, 20-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+y, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex), while in the latter is by age (10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-49y, 50+y, unknown age).

![Blood Pressure](resources/images/chis-ncd-y-003.png)

#### 2.2.4. Body Weight

The data in this section screens for overweight children. In the first section the disaggregation is by age (5-9y, 10-14y, 15-17y, 18-19y, unknown age) , while in the second is by age (0-11m, 1-4y) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

![Body Weight](resources/images/chis-ncd-y-004.png)

#### 2.2.5. Physical Activity

The section provides an overview of the levels of inefficient physical activity in the community. The info for children 0-4 years are disaggregated by age (0-11m and 1-4y) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex). The info for adults is disaggregated by age (20-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+yn unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknown sex). Being the children between the age of 5 and 9 years belonging to what normally is a standardized age group, the disaggregation of the table is just by sex.

#### 2.2.6. Tobacco Use

The data collected give an overview of the use of tobacco among adolescents and among people above 15 years of age.

![Tobacco Use](resources/images/chis-ncd-y-006.png)

#### 2.2.7. Overweight

The collected data provide an overview of the data on 40+ years suffering from diabetes while being overweight (BMI>=25). The data is disaggregated by age (40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+y, unknown age) and by sex (male, female, other, unknonw sex). The section also provides information on screening for overweight adults. The data is disaggregated by age (20-39y, 40-49y, 50-59y, 60-69y, 70+y, unknown age) and sex (male, female, other, unknonw sex).

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - NCDs”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data as per the sections present in the dataset, but the content should be adapted based on the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
