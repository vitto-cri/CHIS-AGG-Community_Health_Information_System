## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - Adolescent Health (AH) module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for adolescent health
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on adolescent health
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - Adolescent Health” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

## 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the AH module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the AH module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2. Datasets Details

### 2.1. Monthly Adolescent Health Dataset

In both the monthly and the yearly datasets the category combinations for the age groups have age groups that go beyond the [WHO definition of adolescents](https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/adolescent-health) “WHO defines 'Adolescents' as individuals in the 10-19 years age group and 'Youth' as the 15-24 year age group. While 'Young People' covers the age range 10-24 years” , and the definition of adolescent reported in the [CHIS guidelines](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/fileadmin/uploads/hdc/Documents/Working_Groups/Community_Data/210128_UNICEF_NY_Community_Health_Workers_Guidance_EN.pdf) “Adolescents are defined as persons aged 10–19 years. Young adolescent refers to 10–14-year-olds, while older adolescent refers to 15–19-year-olds”.This has been done to avoid creating ad hoc age groups for each and every dataset. The age groups above the definition of Adolescent/Youth have been greyed-out and therefore blocked for data entry. Countries should nonetheless edit and apply the age categories that better reflect the local context and guidelines.

#### 2.1.1. Family Planning

The section is set to collect the total number of adolescents and young people seeking family planning methods by age groups (10-14y, 15-19y).

#### 2.1.2. Family Planning & HIV Testing

The section is set to collect the total number of adolescents tested for HIV (by age groups - 10-14y, 15-19y-) and the results of the test (positive, negative, indeterminate).

The second part of the section divides the reached people by type of preventive chemotherapy (Albendazole and Mebendazole).

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - Adolescent Health”.
The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items on the dashboard include data on FP, deworming, drug use, and suicide, but the content should be adapted based in the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
