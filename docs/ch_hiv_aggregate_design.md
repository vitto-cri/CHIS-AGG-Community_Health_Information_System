## 1. Datasets

### 1.1. Configuration Summary

The aggregate CH - HIV module includes:

1. A **monthly dataset** with key data elements for HIV
2. A **yearly dataset** for the follow up of key annual information on HIV
3. **Core indicators** for both datasets
4. A predefined **“CH - HIV” dashboard**

It is recommended that the datasets get assigned to Organisation Units **at the lowest level** of the health system feasible for reporting data, such as Villages or any appropriate community demarcation according to the local context.

### 1.2. Data Elements

The table below summarizes the data elements present in the HIV module. The “Data elements groups” and “Datasets” columns will provide extra information on where the same DEs can be found in the other CHIS modules. This should facilitate the mapping of the package among all its modules and navigate the datasets while avoiding the collection and data entry of the same DEs in multiple locations.

All the DEs in the HIV module are used in the build up of indicators.

## 2.Dataset Details

### 2.1. Monthly HIV Dataset

#### 2.1.1. Family Planning & HIV

The section is set to collect the information necessary to identify the people of reproductive age accessing the service by age group (10-14y, 15-19y); and being tested for HIV by age group (10-14y, 15-19y) and by sex (male, female, other, unknown sex).

The category combinations for the age groups have age groups that go beyond the [WHO definition of adolescents](https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/adolescent-health)  “WHO defines 'Adolescents' as individuals in the 10-19 years age group and 'Youth' as the 15-24 year age group. While 'Young People' covers the age range 10-24 years” . This has been done to avoid creating ad hoc age groups for each and every dataset. The age groups above the definition of Adolescent have been greyed-out and therefore blocked for data entry. Countries should nonetheless edit and apply the age categories that better reflect the local context and guidelines.

## 5. Dashboards

The module includes a predefined dashboard called “CH - HIV”.

The dashboard is divided in two based on the periodicity of the datasets.

The first part is for monthly indicators. The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.

The second part of the dashboard is dedicated to the annual dataset (Annual Household Assessment Indicators). The predefined items analyse and visualize the main areas of the dataset, though the dashboard should be modified to better mirror the local activities.
